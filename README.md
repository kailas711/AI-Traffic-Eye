# YoloV5_Nested_Object_Detection
My first end-to-end computer vision project, starting from data collection to deployment in a webapp.
The project involves 5 steps 
- Data Collection 
- Data cleaning and procesing 
- Model Buidling and training 
- Deployment
The application is deployed in streamlit cloud, try it for yourself!!
