# AI Traffic Eye
Detecting an object inside an object , My first end-to-end computer vision project, starting from data collection to deployment in a webapp. The idea is to find traffic rule violations by 2 wheelers by detecting motorbies carrying more than 2 persons on road. The number of person is arbitary and can be customized.  

The project involved 5 phases 
- Data collection, cleaning and procesing : Uses web scarped data by selenium , manually annotated using Roboflow.
Model Buidling and training : Custom trained on YoloV8n model from Ultralytics hub
Deployment : Deployed in Streamlit community cloud.

**The application is deployed in streamlit cloud, try it for yourself!!**
