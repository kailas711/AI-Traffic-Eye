# Nested Object Detection
Detecting an object inside an object , My first end-to-end computer vision project, starting from data collection to deployment in a webapp. The idea is to find traffic rule violations by 2 wheelers by detecting motorbies carrying more than 2 persons on road. 

**The application is deployed in streamlit cloud, try it for yourself!!**

The project involves 5 steps 
- Data Collection 
- Data cleaning and procesing 
- Model Buidling and training 
- Deployment
